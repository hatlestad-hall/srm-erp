**Stimulus presentation scripts for the SRM paradigm**

This repository contains the MATLAB scripts for the Stimulus-Response Modulation (SRM) paradigm employed in the following papers:
* Rygvold, T. W., Hatlestad-Hall, C. et al. (2021). Do visual and auditory stimulus-specific response modulation reflect different mechanisms of neocortical plasticity? *The European Journal of Neuroscience*, 53(4), 1072â€“1085. https://doi.org/10.1111/ejn.14964
* Rygvold, T. W. et al. (2022). Long-Term Potentiation-Like Visual Synaptic Plasticity Is Negatively Associated With Self-Reported Symptoms of Depression and Stress in Healthy Adults. *Frontiers in Human Neuroscience*, 16, 867675. https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2022.867675
* Rygvold, T. W. et al. (2022). Long term potentiation-like neural plasticity and performance-based memory function. *Neurobiology of Learning and Memory*, 196, 107696. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nlm.2022.107696

Raw resting-state EEG data from the same study is publicly available from: https://doi.org/10.18112/openneuro.ds003775.v1.2.1
The dataset is described in the following paper:
* Hatlestad-Hall, C., Rygvold, T. W., & Andersson, S. (2022). BIDS-structured resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) data extracted from an experimental paradigm. *Data in Brief*, 45, 108647. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2022.108647

A modified, visual stimulus only version of the SRM paradigm is also included. These scripts were used in the following paper:
* Lengali, L., Hippe, et al. (2021). Sensory-Induced Human LTP-Like Synaptic Plasticity - Using Visual Evoked Potentials to Explore the Relation Between LTP-Like Synaptic Plasticity and Visual Perceptual Learning. *Frontiers in Human Neuroscience*, 15, 684573. https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2021.684573
